# Organise My Life - a note taking app (inspiration drawn from [here](https://todoist.com/))

## Purpose

- let you take notes
- let you add due dates
- let you add comments to notes
- let you add labels to notes
- let you add priority to notes
- let you edit/delete notes

## Current problems

- adding a modal without using routing!!

## Web App Structure

- Create diagram
- use MaterialUI, Redux, axios

## things I want to try out

- add testing framework
- use some sort of CI/CD framework (github actions or something on AWS?)
- allow users to sign in with google
- connect actual database
- use eslint to format everything
- typescript?

## Questions

- what the difference between redux and react-redux? How do I know which ones I need?
- what is this material ui makeStyles bullshit?
- should i be passing children components through in PageLayout?
