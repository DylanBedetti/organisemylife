# Organise My Life - a note taking app (inspiration drawn from [here](https://todoist.com/))

## Purpose

- let you take notes
- let you add due dates
- let you add comments to notes
- let you add labels to notes
- let you add priority to notes
- let you edit/delete notes

## Questions

- what the difference between redux and react-redux? How do I know which ones I need?
- should i be passing children components through in PageLayout?
- When do you actually need routes?
- how to build stuff if the libraries don't have react bindings/components??
